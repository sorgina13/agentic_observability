"""
Sample: Group Chat with Agent-Based Manager

What it does:
- Demonstrates the new set_manager() API for agent-based coordination
- Manager is a full ChatAgent with access to tools, context, and observability
- Coordinates a researcher, writer, and reviewer agent to solve tasks collaboratively
- Uses agents created in Microsoft Foundry

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT environment variable configured
- Agents (ResearcherAgentV2, WriterAgentV2, ReviewerAgentV2) created in Foundry
